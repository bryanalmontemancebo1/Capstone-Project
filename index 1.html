    <h1>Bryan Almonte</h1>
    <hr/>
    <h2>Summary</h2>
     Hardworking person that will give my life to whomever I work for and is loyal to me.
     Aspiring to be a web devloper so I can open more avenues in my life and in my family's life.
     Having this as a career is something I have wished for since I was in middle school and wrote
     my first line of code on scratch. Being able to illustrate my skills and having the confidence 
     to build something from scratch is something that has always peaked my interest. Love being able to
     work and change things at any given notice by helping it develop and become the best version of what it 
     can be since things can always be better.
